 If you attack with not enough dex, you get -50% Atk.
 - If you do not meet the strength requirement for a weapon, its maximum damage is 1.
 - Wielding a melee weapon with two hands: -2 Str Req, +25% Atk, +3 Hit Spd.
 - If str requirement is higher, weapon scales with str, else it scales with dex. If requirements are equal, weapon scales with whichever stat is higher.
 - Weapon scales +1 Atk for each str or dex (depending on the weapon scaling) you have.
 - Some weapons scale with both Dex and Str. Scales with either one depending on which is higher. Fists is an example.
 - If attacking from an offhand weapon, you get -5 Atk and -25% Dmg, and +1 Str Req.
 - If attacking with two weapons or more equipped, each weapon other than the main hand weapon has a 50% chance to attack (though with the offhand Atk penalty, the chance is lower).

 - Skills grant bonuses to specific or general cases:
	- Swords skill: +2 Atk, +2 Dmg, +2 Hit Spd. Defensive: +2 dfn while wielding a sword or dagger. Disarm: chance to disarm opponent when attacking with a sword. Chance is (10*your_dex - 10*their_stat)% where their_stat is whichever stat of opponent is greater, dex or str.
	- Cudgels skill: +2 Atk, +2 Dmg, +2 Hit Spd with cudgels. Dent Armor: When you hit with a weapon, 3% chance to dent opponent's armor, seriously damaging the armor (if applicable) and causing a bruise and a random status effect that lasts up to 6 turns. Chance is 10% if you hit with a cudgel.
	- Axes skill: +2 Atk, +2 Dmg, +2 Hit Spd with axes. 10% chance to damage opponent's weapons while wielding an ax.
	- Knives skill: +2 Atk, +1 Dmg, +3 Hit Spd with knives. Jab: When moving away from an adjacent foe, 20% chance to perform a free attack with a knife versus the foe.
	- Marksman skill: +3 Atk, +1 Dmg, +3 Hit Spd with marksman weapons and throwing weapons. You gain the target ability which lets you spend 12 NRG to gain +2 Atk vs. one target enemy for 2 turns.
	- Stealth skill: Assassinate: When you melee attack an opponent while they are stunned or unaware of your presence, you instantly kill them.

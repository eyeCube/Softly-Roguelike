Hazards (bio, chem, radiation) stick around for a long time.
Fires are shorter lasting.

	
TYPES OF DAMAGE:

Physical damage:
	deals Lo chi damage

FIRE damage:
	FIRE resist
	causes TEMP meter to raise.
	When TEMP meter full, you catch FIRE, and TEMP meter stays maxed out for the duration of the status.
	FIRE status:
		damage over time to Lo chi
		fire spreads to other flammable things
		can be put out with water

HAZARD damage:
	Inflicts a HAZARD status.
	All HAZARD damage types are resisted by HAZARD resist.
	BIO damage:
		Causes IMMUNITY meter to raise (depending on your resistance).
		When IMMUNITY meter full, you become ill, and meter stays maxed out for the duration of the status.
		ILL status:
			slow damage over time to Lo and Hi chi
			chance to vomit
			no appetite - cannot eat
	CHEM damage:
		Causes instantaneous effect if not resisted.
			effects short-lived compared to bio effects
		Causes Lo damage over time.
		causes EXPOSURE meter to raise (depending on your resistance).
		When EXPOSURE meter full, you die.
		causes a random one of the following statuses:
			irritation
			paralysis (if airborne)
			blindness (if airborne)
			uncontrollable coughing (if airborne)
			uncontrollable vomiting (if airborne)
	RAD damage:
		Exposure causes RAD meter to increase (depending on your resistance)
		When RAD bar is full, causes mutation, then RAD bar is reset.
			mutation causes a permanent change in the creature
			also permanently lowers maximum Hi chi by 1
	
ELECTRIC damage:
	ELEC resist
	instantaneous effect
	causes instant damage to Hi chi
	damage Lo chi if damage is high enough
		(more damage => more Lo damage)
		LoDamage = int((ELEC damage - resist) / 25)
	causes paralysis if damage is higher
	causes knockback if damage is REALLY high
	causes instant death if (ELECTRIC damage - ELEC resist) >= 100
	
Resistances:
	FIRE
	HAZARD
	ELEC
	
	
Meters:
	FIRE 								(temperature?)
		FIRE damage raises this meter
	BIO 								(immunity, sick?)
		BIO damage raises this meter
	CHEM 								(exposure?)
		CHEM damage raises this meter
	RADS
		RAD damage raises this meter

Chargen:
	Choose:
		name
			up to 20 characters, ASCII values only
		gender
			Male, Female, or Nonbinary
				allow creation of new genders
		background (starting class) 
			These classes only influence your starting conditions. Any character can gain any of these abilities and more. However, it may be difficult and costly to acquire them. To learn a new skill takes a lot of time, so it is impractical to learn in the traditional sense; instead you must pay to have the skills implanted in your brain.
			Note: Not all professions are available to the player at the beginning of the game (i.e. they must be unlocked, first).

Stats:
	Lo qi
		costs Lo qi to attack with heavy weapons
		some enemies deal Lo qi damage
	Hi qi
		costs Hi qi to attack with tech weapons
		some enemies deal Hi qi damage
	AP (Action Points)
		Potential to perform actions; all actions require Action Points to perform and when you run out, your turn ends.
	speed
		how many Action Points you gain per turn
		only increases in rare cases like if you take moon sugar
	attack spd	
		With increased attack speed, attacking becomes more efficient, reducing the number of Action Points required to attack.
		modified by weapons
	move spd
		With increased move speed, moving becomes more efficient, reducing the number of Action Points required to move.
		modified by equipment
	attack
		increases chance to hit foes
		There is no limit to how much Attack you can have, and your chance to hit continues increasing with each additional point in Attack (with diminishing returns).
		It is very important to have a decent Attack value in order to ensure you can successfully hit foes, as it is possible to have only a 5% chance to hit if your foe has 19 more DV than you have Attack.
		It is impossible to have lower than a 5% chance to hit.
	power
		increases damage
	DV
		Dodge Value
		Increases chance to dodge foes' attacks. With negative DV, your foes have a greater chance to hit you. However, increasing DV has little effect until you gain a lot of it, at which point it becomes more and more effective. If (your opponent's Attack - your DV) <= 1 then your opponent has only a 5% chance to hit.
	AV (Armor Value)
	ResBIO (Resist BIO-type damage)
	ResFIR (Resist FIRE-type damage)

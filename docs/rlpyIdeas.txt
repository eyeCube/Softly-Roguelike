INVESTIGATE:
	ashes burning, fire not killing corpses.
	TRACK: HOW MANY THINGS WITH STATUS EFFECTS ARE THERE?
		after something burns to death, it should be removed from the game entirely, including being removed from all lists like the status effect list.
	FIRE REMOVAL HAPPENING TOO OFTEN
	CORPSES BURNING TO DEATH INDEFINITELY
		ASHES NOT GETTING CREATED
	FIRE LIGHTS SHOULD SHINE AT END OF TURN, UNSHINE ONLY IF NECESSARY
	FIRE SHOULD NOT DIE AND REGEN EVERY GAME TURN, THIS WILL SLOW DOWN THE GAME A LOT.
	SET_FIRE GETTING CALLED TOO OFTEN
	GAME_UPDATE GETTING CALLED TOO OFTEN
	IN_RANGE GETTING CALLED A LOT
	maybe we shouldn't sleep so much? Or try wait instead of check for input?
	refresh
	
	
	
Todo:
	overhaul status effect meters system
		fire resistance = how much heat you can take before catching fire.
		bio res = how infected you can get before getting sick, etc.
		elemental damage is fixed; flamethrower always deals 50 fire damage or w/e, regardless of resistance
		meters drop faster if more full? (hotter you are, quicker you cool?)
			may not be needed and may complicate things.
		Like Dark Souls.
	stealth
		sneak - move slowly and quietly, making no noise and reducing chance to take damage from traps, etc.
	consolidate item IDs all into one long list
		weapons, ingredients, ammo, armor, interactables, food, consumables, containers, etc.
		no item IDs overlap, so this way you can put ingredients for crafting recipes just by putting their ID in there
	light sources
		torches
		candles
			wick doesn't have to burn with capillary action candle
			any type of oil can be used
			oil lamp / cup candle:
				wick, cup, oil as fuel
			naked candle:
				fat or wax, wick
			candle
	figure out
		what to do when you equip something that gives you a flag/component
			what if you already have that flag/component?
	writing
		writing in dust on floor
		graffiti
		pen on paper
		terminal typing
	alcoholic beverages
		mead (honey wine) (can produce by throwing honey in a pot with water and passing time)
			if I do this maybe there should be some way to pass long periods of time like resting for weeks
				premature mead
				mead
				aged mead
		wine
		moonshine (can produce it with a still)
	add minerals
		flint - can produce sparks from metal striking
		quartz - can produce sparks from metal striking
	test speed of ECS system, including:
		new status effect processor
	action: aim
		increases accuracy +5 every time you use it
		if you perform any action other than aiming or firing, the aim accuracy bonus is lost.
	shooting
		if ammo is balls, then you need black powder in inventory to load the gun
		arrows can disable shields, need to remove arrow to make shield usable
	hunger and thirst
		could implement as extensions of Hp and Mp (Lo and Hi points). Similar to Dishonored, except you slowly lose Lo/Hi due to starvation/dehydration, respectively.
			Pros: simple. Intuitive. Easy to understand, easy to implement. Streamlined. Increases urgency of hunger and thirst intuitively without needing to add artificial penalties for being hungry etc. Reduces HUD clutter. Can implement hunger/thirst in NPCs effectively and easily, allowing them to need to eat to recover, which improves gameplay mechanics. Zelda BOTW did it.
			Cons: annoying to lose Hp and especially Mp over time, since typically you would gain them slowly over time. Could die of starvation at unopportune times, but that's typical of RLs.
	item mods change quality, etc.
		different quality levels have different colors for their text.
	overhaul hud
	examine overhaul
		allows you to look at all items in a tile, not just the one on top (also details terrain)
	backpack, the magical technology that makes items have no volume
	replace for loops with numpy iterators to speed up/optimize the game.
	level generation
	eating + corpse eating
	status effects - fire, bio to start IN PROGRESS
		fire tiles separate from burning status effect
	skills IN PROGRESS
	implement delayed actions ( immediate actions vs. ) IN PROGRESS
	town w/ shops
	saving (use pickle)
		save everything in game into ONE object, then serialize that object.
		deserialize to load.
		https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/comments/bd7oh5/memory_usage_for_large_maps/
	improve speed
		https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/comments/bhrmnr/how_to_make_game_less_laggy/
	implants, robotic limbs
	improve sounds - enemy hearing, reacting to sense events
		sound of fire burning should only play when wood is burning
		sound of fire should also be much quieter
	aiming - similar to Sea of Green implementation
	alert: can hear fire through walls
	body swapping (controlling other entities)
		change pc pointer to the object you want to control. Should be easy.
	materials affect properties of objects
	overhaul fire system: mix tilemap's grid_fires with fire manager
		- make fires not thing-based but tile-based entities.
		Status manager handles fire DOT
		fire spreads when you move
	checker the tiles in the grid, add random noise to color
	Things drop their inventory when they die
	terminals
	companions
	different AI for each creature type
	Brogue-style UI with sidebar showing things in view, things you can hear, etc.
	things get bloody during combat
	holes that you can fall through
	dark areas which are barely lit up are colored blue-ish
	when in water:
		vision affected if submerged
		lose items if high water that is flowing
		items in inventory get wet / rust if high water
	weapons types
	wrestling
	robotics
		drone bots, swarm bots, nanobots
		robots / androids / AI systems
		cyborg prosthetics, chip implants
	railguns mounted guns
	add_listener_sounds for monsters who can hear
	make game exportable on as many platforms as possible
		https://benob.itch.io/expelledrl 
		this game is python tcod and exportable.
	sounds should be visible as a colored musical note on the map.
		what you see, hear, feel, smell, taste should only give a message if necessary to express to the player what's happening. Separate senses?
	only update fov if:
		thing moved
		tilemap updated opacity of one or more tiles
	mutations - have pros and cons
		chargen allows you to select genetic mutations
	overencumberance, volume???
	displacing actors
Done:
	gear, equipping gear
	chargen
	highlight the player's tile background (optionally)	
	different types of damage
	overhauled fire
	status effects make messages when added or removed
		only for player?
		could be for all actors in vision of the player but this could be reserved for if you have superpowers of observation.

Combat:
	Knowledge
		while you can see your foe, you gain knowledge about them each turn they are in vision.
		Knowledge gained affected by distance and the number of foes you can examine
			foes that can be examined are close enough to examine while also being in sight; of course player cannot be blinded
		Engaging in combat grants the most knowledge.
	
	Reach:
		if a weapon has reach, then you can perform a free attack by stepping towards a foe
		foe must be in the direction you move
		weapons with reach get -25% Atk when fighting in corridors or corners (surrounded by 5 or more adjacent walls)

Portals???	

Worldgen
	Levelgen
		spanning tree
		
	
Fire behavior
	Check for dying conditions:
		Each turn there's a chance to die depending on the fuel (or lack thereof) available in that tile.
		If the tile of the fire is shallows or water or deepwater, then the fire goes out. If it's a puddle, the puddle turns into steam and the fire dies.
	Each turn there's a chance to leap to an adjacent tile, adding a new fire at that spot.
	When something on fire moves, the tile it moves to catches fire.
	When something is on fire, everything in its inventory takes burn damage too.
	
Electricty status
	idea: add an electric meter
		when full, you get paralyzed
	
	
	
Material of object influences several things about it. Rather than having dozens of describing variables about the object's physics, it just has one variable: material. Examples of how material affects its interactivity:
	brittleness - likelihood to shatter when killed
	malleability - tendency to lose its shape when struck
	bounciness - tendency to bounce when striking a surface
	reflectiveness - ability to reflect lasers
	transparency - ability for light/LOS to pass through
	flammability - brightness / intensity of the flame it produces
	friction - tendency to slow when sliding across surfaces
	density - affects settling point when suspended in fluid
	
	
Hazards (bio, chem, radiation) stick around for a long time.
Fires are shorter lasting.
Brightness of fires based on the material of the fuel.
	wood burns bright gold, red, yellow
	flesh does not burn brightly, burns red
	cloth burns medium brightness
	oil burns medium, burns green
	tar burns bright, burns gold
	fungus burns dimly blue
levels.py could contain code for generating floors based on their depth
	uses proc. gen. functions from TileMap

	
TYPES OF DAMAGE:

Physical damage:
	deals Lo chi damage

FIRE damage:
	FIRE resist
	causes TEMP meter to raise.
	When TEMP meter full, you catch FIRE, and TEMP meter stays maxed out for the duration of the status.
	FIRE status:
		damage over time to Lo chi
		fire spreads to other flammable things
		can be put out with water

HAZARD damage:
	Inflicts a HAZARD status.
	All HAZARD damage types are resisted by HAZARD resist.
	BIO damage:
		Causes IMMUNITY meter to raise (depending on your resistance).
		When IMMUNITY meter full, you become ill, and meter stays maxed out for the duration of the status.
		ILL status:
			slow damage over time to Lo and Hi chi
			chance to vomit
			no appetite - cannot eat
	CHEM damage:
		Causes instantaneous effect if not resisted.
			effects short-lived compared to bio effects
		Causes Lo damage over time.
		causes EXPOSURE meter to raise (depending on your resistance).
		When EXPOSURE meter full, you die.
		causes a random one of the following statuses:
			irritation
			paralysis (if airborne)
			blindness (if airborne)
			uncontrollable coughing (if airborne)
			uncontrollable vomiting (if airborne)
	RAD damage:
		Exposure causes RAD meter to increase (depending on your resistance)
		When RAD bar is full, causes mutation, then RAD bar is reset.
			mutation causes a permanent change in the creature
			also permanently lowers maximum Hi chi by 1
	
ELECTRIC damage:
	ELEC resist
	instantaneous effect
	causes instant damage to Hi chi
	damage Lo chi if damage is high enough
		(more damage => more Lo damage)
		LoDamage = int((ELEC damage - resist) / 25)
	causes paralysis if damage is higher
	causes knockback if damage is REALLY high
	causes instant death if (ELECTRIC damage - ELEC resist) >= 100
	
Resistances:
	FIRE
	HAZARD
	ELEC
	
	
Meters:
	FIRE 								(temperature?)
		FIRE damage raises this meter
	BIO 								(immunity, sick?)
		BIO damage raises this meter
	CHEM 								(exposure?)
		CHEM damage raises this meter
	RADS
		RAD damage raises this meter

		background (starting class) 
			These classes only influence your starting conditions. Any character can gain any of these abilities and more. However, it may be difficult and costly to acquire them. To learn a new skill takes a lot of time, so it is impractical to learn in the traditional sense; instead you must pay to have the skills implanted in your brain.

Hunger
	In the apocolypse, good food is scarce. Survival requires being able to find and secure vital food supplies.
	Hunger loss rate:
		1 per turn
		50 per attack
		5 per move (25 if sprinting)
	Hunger stages
		Hunger: 50,000 maximum
		full		95%+
		satiated	90%+
		nourished	85%+
		hungry		75%+
		starving	50%+
		famished	25%+
		emaciated	<25%
		dead		0
	Multiply Food units Factor: 250
		(all food items recover hunger units equal to their food units * 250)


Stats:
	Lo qi
		costs Lo qi to attack with heavy weapons
		some enemies deal Lo qi damage
	Hi qi
		costs Hi qi to attack with tech weapons
		some enemies deal Hi qi damage
	AP (Action Points)
		Potential to perform actions; all actions require Action Points to perform and when you run out, your turn ends.
	speed
		how many Action Points you gain per turn
		only increases in rare cases like if you take moon sugar
	attack spd	
		With increased attack speed, attacking becomes more efficient, reducing the number of Action Points required to attack.
		modified by weapons
	move spd
		With increased move speed, moving becomes more efficient, reducing the number of Action Points required to move.
		modified by equipment
	attack
		increases chance to hit foes
		There is no limit to how much Attack you can have, and your chance to hit continues increasing with each additional point in Attack (with diminishing returns).
		It is very important to have a decent Attack value in order to ensure you can successfully hit foes, as it is possible to have only a 5% chance to hit if your foe has 19 more DV than you have Attack.
		It is impossible to have lower than a 5% chance to hit.
	power
		increases damage
	DV
		Dodge Value
		Increases chance to dodge foes' attacks. With negative DV, your foes have a greater chance to hit you. However, increasing DV has little effect until you gain a lot of it, at which point it becomes more and more effective. If (your opponent's Attack - your DV) <= 1 then your opponent has only a 5% chance to hit.
	AV (Armor Value)
	ResBIO (Resist BIO-type damage)
	ResFIR (Resist FIRE-type damage)
	
	
	NOTE: reload time:
	 #reload time is separate from time it takes to refill the mag. pistol for example takes just one turn to replace the mag. Takes longer to actually fill the mag if you don't already have a full mag.
